About the Project
This project is a basic Snake Game, where the player controls a snake, which grows in length each time it eats a piece of food. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself. This project demonstrates the use of Java Swing for graphical user interface and basic game mechanics.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
Eat the food that appears randomly on the screen to grow longer.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body; otherwise, the game will end.
Aim to get the highest score possible by eating more food!
